This folder contains OD600 (Spec.xlsx), Respiration (T12_data and T24_data folders, separated by day: either day 12 or day 24) and Protist trait (Master_dataset_prot_traits.csv) raw data.

Each dataset has an associated R code (in main branch that extracts the data from the data files and reproduces the analyses presented in the paper).

1. OD600 data is paired with R code: Spec_analyses_Git.R
2. Respirometry data is paired with R code: Respirometry_analysis_Git.R
3. Protist trait data is paired with R code: Prot_trait_analysis_Git.R
